## üöÄ Features

### üîÑ Automated Workflow
- **Image Scraping**: Automatically scrape images from URLs
- **AI Classification**: Multi-method classification (Deep Learning + Feature-based + Rule-based)

  ### üéØ Classification System
- **Deep Learning**: ResNet50-based classifier
- **Feature-based**: Traditional ML with handcrafted features
- **Rule-based**: Heuristic classification based on image characteristics
- **Ensemble**: Weighted combination of all methods
